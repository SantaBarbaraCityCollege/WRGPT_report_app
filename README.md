# WRGPT_report_app
 
This is a collaboration project with fellow SBCC CS students.  

WRGPT stands for World Rec Gambling Poker Tournament which is an free to play, email based poker tournament that started in 1992 by members of the USENET group rec.gambling (later rec.gambling.poker).  As many of today's poker pros learned to play poker by being members of this USENET group, some still play to this day (Andy Bloch and Richard Brodie(Quiet Lion)).  At its peak, during the boom days of online poker in the US (early 2000s) over 1000 players participated, though now that number is ~500+.

The purpose of this application is to collect analyze and report metrics on all players in this tournament, providing a strategic advantage for the user of the application.  All hands are played and the results of them are freely available on the WRGPT.org website though hole cards are only showed when the hand goes to completion.
